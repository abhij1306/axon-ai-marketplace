## Future Scope

Axon AI is currently a prototype. Future development could expand its functionality significantly:

- **Full Backend Integration:** Implement a real backend (e.g., using Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI) to allow sellers to create accounts and list their own AI tools.
- **User Authentication:** Add a secure authentication system (e.g., OAuth, JWT) for buyers and sellers.
- **E-commerce Functionality:** Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) to handle subscriptions or purchases of AI tools directly on the platform.
- **Database for Tools:** Replace the mock data with a robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to store and manage a large number of AI tools.
- **Blog & Content Platform:** Create a blog to publish articles about AI trends, case studies, and tutorials, driving organic traffic and establishing brand authority.
- **Advanced Marketplace Features:** Implement advanced search, user ratings and reviews, and personalized recommendations for AI tools.
- **Consultation Booking System:** Integrate a calendar and booking system to allow users to schedule free consultations directly on the site.
